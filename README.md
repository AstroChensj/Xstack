## :pirate_flag: What is <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-weight: 700;">Xstack</span> ?

<u><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-weight: 700;">Xstack</span> is a comprehensive standalone pipeline code for **X-ray spectral (rest-frame) shifting and stacking**.</u>

In the era of eROSITA All Sky X-ray Survey (eRASS), the code should be very useful, if you have a special sample (of point sources) selected in other bands (*infra-red color, optical line/line ratios, variability*, etc), and you would like to see how their **averaged X-ray spectral shape** looks like. You simply download your targets' spectra from [eROSITA archive](https://erosita.mpe.mpg.de/dr1/erodat/data/download/), and <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-weight: 700;">Xstack</span> them (see [below](#ledger-how-to-use-xstack) for examples). 

## :bulb: How <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-weight: 700;">Xstack</span> works: a very brief introduction

### Difficulties, and solutions

X-ray spectral stacking is **non-trivial** compared to optical spectral stacking. The difficulties arise from two facts:

:cold_sweat: X-ray has much fewer photon counts (Poisson), meaning that spectral **counts and uncertainties cannot be scaled simultaneously** (as compared to optical);

:cold_sweat: X-ray has non-diagonal, complex response, meaning that the **response needs to be taken into account** when stacking.

To tackle these issues, we develop **<span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-weight: 700;">Xstack</span>**: a standalone pipeline code for X-ray spectral stacking. The methodology is to first sum all (rest-frame) PI spectra, without any scaling; and then sum the response files (ARFs and RMFs), each with appropriate weighting factors to preserve the overall spectral shape. The preservation of Poisson statistics for the data (and Gaussian for the background) ensures the validity of subsequent spectral fitting (via e.g., XSPEC).

### Key features of <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-weight: 700;">Xstack</span>

:star_struck: properly preserve X-ray spectral shape, by assigning data-driven response weighting factors; 

:star_struck: preserve Poisson statistics; 

:star_struck: support Galactic absorption correction, if an additional ***nH*** value (in units of 1 $\text{cm}^{-2}$) for each spectrum is given.

## :wrench: Prerequisites and Installation

To install <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-weight: 700;">Xstack</span> (along with the prerequisite packages), simply put:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/AstroChensj/Xstack.git
cd Xstack
python -m pip install .
```
`python -m` ensures that all required packages are installed for your current conda environment only (i.e., the path where your python is called, `which python`).

Troubleshooting:

- If you encounter network issues (e.g., `Port 443`) when installing with `https`, try `ssh` instead (see [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2643502/git-how-to-solve-permission-denied-publickey-error-when-using-git) for setup of github `ssh`):
  
  ```shell
  ssh -T git@github.com
  git clone git@github.com:AstroChensj/Xstack.git
  ```

## :ledger: How to use <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-weight: 700;">Xstack</span>
Stacking X-ray spectra with <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-weight: 700;">Xstack</span> is simple: you can either call it from [**command line**](#one-command-line-version), or invoke it as a [**python module**](#two-python-module-version). 

In either case, <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-weight: 700;">Xstack</span> requires the following as input:

- individual source `PI` spectra, with proper headers following OGIP standards; additional redshift file (with `.z` extension) and Galactic nH file (with `.nh` extension) under the same directory as each source `PI` spectrum;
  
- background `PI` spectra (with proper `BACKSCAL` parameters);
  
- effective area curve `ARF`s (extracted for source region);

- and response matrix `RMF`s.

The output will be: 

- stacked source `PI` spectrum;

- stacked background `BKGPI` spectrum (already scaled);

- stacked `ARF`;

- stacked `RMF`;
  
- and first contributing energy file `FENE`.

### :one: Command line version

- A simple and quick example:

  ```shell
  runXstack your_filelist.txt --prefix ./results/stacked_
  ```
  
  
  - And you will get the stacked spectra `./results/stacked_pi.fits`, `./results/stacked_bkgpi.fits`, and stacked response files `./results/stacked_arf.fits`, `./results/stacked_rmf.fits`, and `./results/stacked_fene.fits` which stores the first contributing energy of each individual source. 
  
  - `runXstack` is the alias for `python3 /path/to/your/Xstack/Xstack_scripts/Xstack_autoscript.py`, which should be set automatically after `python -m pip install .`.
  
  - `your_filelist.txt` stores the absolute path of the PI spectrum file for each source. The PI spectrum should follow OGIP standards – its header (of extension `SPECTRUM`) should have keywords helping <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-weight: 700;">Xstack</span> to find the corresponding bkg PI spectrum file (`BACKFILE`), the RMF (`RESPFILE`) and ARF (`ANCRFILE`). An example of `your_filelist.txt` would be:
 
    ```
    /path/to/your/PI_001.fits
    /path/to/your/PI_002.fits
    /path/to/your/PI_003.fits
    # ...
    ```
    Note that under each directory, it is assumed there exist a redshift file and Galactic nH file, with naming convention like `/path/to/your/PI_001.fits.z` and `/path/to/your/PI_001.fits.nh`. The redshift value and Galactic nH value ([1 cm^-2]) are stored in these two files, separately.
  
  - `1.0` and `2.3`  are lower/upper end of the energy range (in keV) for computing flux. The flux represents the contribution from each source’s PI spectrum to the total stacked spectrum, and will be used as the weighting factors when stacking ARFs/RMFs.
  
  - `SHP` is the response weighting method, assuming all sources to be stacked have the same spectral shape (the minimum assumption). Under this method, the response weighting factor is calculated from flux (in a data-driven way). 
  
- Or more sophisticatedly, specify more parameters:

  ```shell
  runXstack your_filelist.txt --prefix ./results/stacked_ --rsp_weight_method SHP --rsp_proj_gamma 2.0 --flux_energy_lo 1.0 --flux_energy_hi 2.3 --nthreads 20 --ene_trc 0.2 --same_rmf AllSourcesUseSameRMF.rmf
  ```

  -  `nthreads` specifies the number of CPUs used for shifting RMF.

  - `ene_trc` specifies the energy (keV) below which the ARF is unreliable and should manually be truncated. For example, for eROSITA there may be some calibration issues below 0.2 keV, so you can set this parameter to `0.2`.

  - `same_rmf` : the RMF files are usually large, and sometimes all sources to be stacked could share the same RMF in order to save space. Under this case, you can specify the file name of the common RMF with `same_rmf`.

- If you want to do bootstrap, that is also easy:

  ```shell
  runXstack your_filelist.txt --prefix ./results/stacked_ --rsp_weight_method SHP --rsp_project_gamma 2.0 --flux_energy_lo 1.0 --flux_energy_hi 2.3 --nthreads 20 --ene_trc 0.2 --same_rmf AllSourcesUseSameRMF.rmf --resample_method bootstrap --num_bootstrap 100
  ```

- You can run `runXstack -h` to get the documentation of all the above parameters. Or equivalently check below:

## :warning: Limitations so far ... and contributions are welcome!

<span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-weight: 700;">Xstack</span> is a great tool for stacking large number of point source (AGN) spectra, especially when focusing on average spectral shapes. While we acknowledge a few limitations, they are beyond current scope and won't affect the core functionality of the code. That said, contributions are still welcome!

- **Preserving only spectral **shape**; **normalization** information is lost**
  - Each spectrum carries both **normalization** and **shape** information. For **X-ray** spectral stacking, it is in principle not possible to preserve both simultaneously, due to the complex response. <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-weight: 700;">Xstack</span> is designed to preserve the **shape** (by assigning optimized response weighting factors), which necessarily results in the loss of **absolute normalization**. One possible improvement could be to stack the shape (with <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-weight: 700;">Xstack</span>) and normalization (with e.g., 1.0-2.3 keV image stacking) separately, and then rescale the shape spectrum using the average luminosity/flux computed independently.

- **You can only stack spectra from one instrument for now**
  - <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-weight: 700;">Xstack</span> assumes all spectra to be stacked share the same energy grids (from RMF). This means that you can only stack spectra from only one instrument (eROSITA or XMM or Chandra or EP...), as different instruments generally have different energy grid settings. Potential improvement could focus on creating a common energy grid for all spectra before shifting and stacking.
